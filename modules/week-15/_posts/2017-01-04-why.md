# Why AR.js

We believe in the Web, as a collaborative and accessible environment. We also believe in the Augmented Reality technology, as a new communication medium, that can help people to see the reality in new, exciting ways. We see Augmented Reality (AR) used everyday for a lot of useful applications, from art, to education, also for fun.

We strongly believe that such a powerful technology, that can help people and leverage their creativity, should be free in some way. Also collaborative, if possible. And so, we continue the work started by Jerome Etienne, in bringing AR on the Web, as a free and Open Source technology.

The project is now under a Github organization, that you can find at <a href="https://github.com/ar-js-org" target="_new">https://github.com/ar-js-org</a> and you can ask to be part of it, for free.
